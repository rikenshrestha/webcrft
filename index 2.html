            <p>Record Heat Wave Sweeps Across the Globe, Triggering Climate Disaster<br>

                The world is currently experiencing an unprecedented climate disaster as a <br>record heat wave
                sweeps
                across
                the
                globe. From the Arctic Circle to the tropics,<br> temperatures are soaring to new heights, causing
                devastating
                consequences for <br>the environment, human health, and the economy.

                According to the latest data<br> from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
                the
                average<br>
                global
                temperature in the last month has been the highest on record, surpassing the<br> previous peak set
                in 2016.
                Many
                regions are experiencing temperatures that are<br> 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit above average, and
                some are
                even
                hotter than that.</p>

            <h2>Rise of the sea</h2>
            <p>Rise of the sea<br>Global sea levels are rising as a result of human-caused global warming, with recent
                rates being
                unprecedented over the past 2,500-plus years. Sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related
                to global warming: the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers, and the expansion of seawater
                as it warms.</p>

            <h2>Climate change effects on Forest</h2>
            <p>Forest productivity is changing as a result of our warming climate. With warmer temperatures lasting
                longer, our plants have a longer growing season and more time to photosynthesize. This can lead to
                enhanced forest growth and carbon sequestration.</p>

            <h2>Global Warming</h2>
            <p>Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's surface observed since the pre-industrial period
                (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases
                heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere. This term is not interchangeable with the
                term "climate change."</p>
